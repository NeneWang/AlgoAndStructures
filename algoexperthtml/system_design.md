## Design Fundamentals
System designinterviews leads with systems and how to design the items. Once you consume all the content you will be able to tackle all the contents, and see in the next video.


## What are Design Fundamentals
What type of investigation, fundamentals knoweldge behind system design interviews.

Where a solution is either objectively correct or not. A worse being tacke, the client server model, netword and how machines communicate to properly design a system complex. The second category: key categories, trading up, design fundamentals, each key characteristics, that you have to be weell versed.

Have an assistance, catches, leader election, bread and butter, key characteristics. Fundamentals, 

Tech either as components really using zoom keeper. Using real life tools having design interview, To justify the interviewer. Between key parts and grocery fo design fundamentals, this comes to put you int he next steps. 
Next video informative and next ones.

## Client Server Model  
Ip Addressess as IP addressess. The expert when you in the browser find the dns. Http is a way to save and algoexpert servers, pack into packages. into the addreessess gets the request, would use the source address and 
use it to send in response. Servers are machiens called clients, a server usually listen for response in distinct ports. You have to specify which oport you want to communicate. IP address the appartment, the port as the apartment numbers. Most clients know which port to use
know what port to use. Mostly speaks to port 80. So here is to open up. Eventually receives the request, understands the format, and the server understand you want to look an HTML of the Algoexpert. 

All computers talk around the world, client server concepts, type in the browser communicating throught the browser.

## Network Protocols

Majority admitidly low level. All this things are network and system design inteviews only need ot know them at high level. You will likely have the aha moments. How they communicate and what a protocol is.
An agreed upon rules, when two people meet each other, have some exchange and may even have an protocol. A communication protocol, we are going to exchange the words, abvery common. protocol between two human beings

Sent and receive, over the network, sent over the internet, from one machine to another. The format the order, if there should be some sort of respomnse, from one to another. The majority you don't need to kno about them.

Those are the ones we want to cover

### IP
An Internet Protocol. In context is that the modern interne truns in UIP. When a machine tries to interact and sends data, is sent in the IP package, and data thats sent from one machine to another.
By way and memory, other ways as bytes and have two main sections. Headers source and IP address, the stimation and the estimations and quick pause.

The header you can know what the total size of the package is. It turns out there are two versions. With the IPV4 and now being used the IPV6 which is now getting started to being used. The rest this part here,
The data of the machine, and limited in size, 2^16 bytes, which is actually not that much, Sending an image, way more than 2^16 bytes. Likely no fit, the IP packages, when you have multiple IP packages, you dont actually get a way to receive all the data that you were trying to send and neither the 
order of them. Is really ment to solve and serve the IP ways, and the order in which they are readed, they are guaranteed or at least know if some packages are being corrupted, you will know and receive on a incorruptible way. All the applications being used
Because of this things being solved, that cant be accomplished alone. That really isnt useful. working in the networking field. But is important to know from a high level of understanding. What have the PCP, or something like this. Some information, the rest are here, and erase, here the data having
the TCP 



### TCP

Web servers is first going t create a TCP connection, through an handshake, basically communcaites with another package, we are now connected, and both machines send data to each other, the connection can be ended if unsuccessfully connected. A more powerful wrapper along the internet.
Can use to really define meaning ful and easy to use. All sending in these underlined packages. HTTP, is a protocol built on top, introduces a higher level abstraction. Is the response request paradome. One
machine sends one machine request response, to easi9ly build easy to mantian systems. Request that have this defined properties, the power and rigor to visualize hwow this requests look like. Kepepo in mind they are arbitrary just the stuff

The hos and ports, http methods to have here, they basically describe the purpose of the request. retrieving data from the servers, providing data from the server, to delete some data. You asa developer relies int he server logic whatever you like. Really depending on the server.
The path is where you have logic on the server. A server might have have different logic, payment information, making an actual painting, you had a slash auth paths, the request would likely have to do with authentication.00


### HTTP

Just the data, piece of data in JSON format, int h similar format, one improtant field being the status codes, specific inks by normal API standards are error codes, that they might not had been found.
Accepts JSON, defines endpoints, get and post endpoints, console logging stuff, headers and methods of the requests, the body of the rquests. Hey I receive the POST requests. in the top terminal listingin to the curl localhost3000/hello.

A bunch of different protocols since we haven't specified anything else we ge the GET requests witht he response of the servers. Headers with the metadata, post requests, headers where we issue. Applications / Json.

As specification of Data. Food point bar. 
Here we have the body, and being unfamiliar, why http is so rare. Those protocols and transformation of data. Developing a large scale system, simple endpoints, as data wasn't formatted as it should be.

A key take waways is that these three are very important protocols. Http is more relevant, some of the request. methods pathings.

## Storage

### Databases

Databases, in lore, lives somewhere in the memory. Is the memories, always. Save files, 
Your computer and machines, very the server, Is persistance, database thats on the database, if it is stored, it is percepted, and stored onn the database, scrashes, once is boot up. A lot of database, is stored


### Disk

### Memory

### Persistent Storage
